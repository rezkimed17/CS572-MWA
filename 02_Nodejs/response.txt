1. 
setTimeout schedule a callback to run after a specific time, and registered in the timers phase of the event loop.
setImmediate schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events' callbacks.
So if an opearation don't require I/O callbacks or connections via network, then it should be with setImmediate. 
in the other hand if the operation require I/O callbacks or connections via network, tthen it should be with setTimeout.

2.
setImmediate run at check phase, for process.nextTick it has its own queue (like priority queue) and it is handled before setImmediate. 
So if we have an operation that needs to be done instantly we need to use process.nextTick, it may block the loop if used to much.
